# Air Canvas

Just imagine how it would have been that whatever we draw with our fingers in the air gets actually drawn on some surface and you could have been able to see that drawing with your eyes rather than pressurising your brain to imagine and make a picture in itself. Well, you would be able to see it as long as you want. Just imagine that you would be able to draw anything without using pens, pencils, brushes, etc and save it to your smart phone or PC for future use. Just imagine that you wave your finger in the air and a message is sent to your peers without typing that message manually. This project is a way to convert all your imaginations into reality where anything can be drawn on the screen by just waving your fingers in the air.

## Getting Started

The project presents a software application which, on launching, displays a drawing platform a window showing the frames captured by the camera (attached to the PC) in succession. When you draw anything using your forefinger in the air  before the camera, that drawing will be drawn on the drawing platform beside. You can also change the color and thickness of the curves drawn on the screen by suitable keys and track-bars. 

### Prerequisites

Language used is python-3.x and the environment is ubuntu-18.04-LTS
Packages used is opencv-python and pygame


### Installing

The language used is python-3.x which can be downloaded by the following snippet on Linux and can be edited on any local editor.

```
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
To check whether the python is installed or not, you can check its version by: 

```

```
In this project we have used two packges of python namely openCV and pygame. To download them use the following snippet:

```
$pip3 install opencv-python
$pip3 install pygame
```
To check for the installation of the packages, open the python terminal by typing ```python3``` and type the following:

If everything works fine then you can proceed with our code.
